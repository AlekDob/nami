- [10:00] (Alek) fix(macOS): remove deferred markdown rendering that caused LazyVStack thrashing crash. The `@State markdownReady` in ChatBubble was resetting when LazyVStack recycled views, creating infinite height-jump cycles (truncated→full→recycle→truncated→...). Safe to remove because NSTextView was already replaced with native `Text(AttributedString)` on Feb 18 — the deferred rendering was a workaround for NSTextView.ensureLayout() which no longer applies.
- [16:00] (Alek) feat(memory): Second Brain system — knowledge entries con auto-tagging LLM. Nuove tabelle SQLite (knowledge, tags, knowledge_tags) + FTS5. 3 nuovi tool: memorySave, memoryRecall, memoryTag. System prompt aggiornato con istruzioni auto-save. Embeddings abilitati di default se OPENAI_API_KEY presente. Ricerca unificata chunks + knowledge.
