## Memory Optimization
- Split MEMORY.md from 637 lines (23KB) to 37 lines (1.6KB)
- Created thematic files: dieta-roberta.md, x-twitter.md, posthog.md, quack.md, bookmarks.md, voice-project.md
- Fixed `store.ts:reindexAll()` to index all .md files in root memory dir (not just MEMORY.md)

## Mac Remote Access (NEW FEATURE)
- Built Mac Agent (`~/nami-agent/server.js`) — plain Node.js, zero deps, port 7777
- Endpoints: `/health`, `/file?path=`, `/exec` with bearer auth + command whitelist
- Created Nami tools: `macFileRead` + `macExec` in `src/tools/mac-remote.ts`
- Tailscale already configured (Mac: 100.89.38.120, Server: 100.81.200.26)
- launchd plist for auto-start: `com.nami.mac-agent.plist`
- End-to-end tested: server reads files and executes commands on Mac via Tailscale

## Roberta's Diet
- Extracted diet PDF from Doctor C Fertility (5 pages)
- Saved as `dieta-roberta.md` in Nami's thematic memory on server

## iOS Chat Font Size Reduction
- Reduced chat font from `Font.body` (~17pt) to `Font.system(size: 15)` across 3 files
- `MeowTheme.swift`: `body` and `mono` now use explicit 15pt size
- `ChatBubble.swift`: user text aligned to `MeowTheme.body` instead of system `.body`
- `MarkdownText.swift`: bold/italic/bold-italic use `MeowTheme.body` as base font

## iOS Typewriter Effect Re-enabled
- Re-activated typewriter effect on iOS only (`#if os(iOS)`, macOS skips it)
- Rewrote `startTypewriter()` to use word chunks (3 words/tick, 60ms) instead of char-by-char (caused scroll freeze)
- `ChatBubble`: plain `Text` during typewriter (no `MarkdownText` parsing), switches to full markdown when done
- Previous bug: markdown re-parsing on every character update caused scroll freeze on macOS

## Documentation
- Migrated brain from `.quack/brain/` to `documentation/` (v2 format)
- Created pattern, decision, diary for Mac Remote Access
